# giglist

Giglist is an fullstack MERN app for musicians that solves the problem of lost setlists. It allows the user to add thier song reptoire and build different setlists using those songs. A unique feature of this app is that we've included a custum metronome for each song. The BPM display next to each song will blink at the appropriate BPM when clicked.
